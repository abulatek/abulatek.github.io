*Hello!*
------
My name is Alyssa Bulatek (she/her) and I am a [second-year graduate student](https://astro.ufl.edu/directory/alyssa-bulatek/) in the Astronomy department at the University of Florida working with Dr. Adam Ginsburg. I graduated from Macalester College in May 2020. If you would like to know more about things I have gotten to do in my career so far, please see [my CV](https://abulatek.github.io/cv/).

Interests
------
**Research:** I'm currently studying **star formation** in the Milky Way. Specifically, I'm trying to uncover molecular tracers of different processes related to star formation in a molecular cloud near the Galactic Center called "The Brick." I am also broadly interested in observational radio astronomy and radio/infrared/optical instrumentation. You can check out some of the projects I have worked on in the Research section of [my CV](https://abulatek.github.io/files/abulatek_CV.pdf).

[**Rocketry:**](https://abulatek.github.io/hobbies/) At Macalester, I was involved with Macalester's High Power Rocketry team ([here's their Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/MacRocketry)), and I participated in the design and build processes for several competition rockets: Quantum Field Theory I, Quantum Heavy, and Mach-alester I. Our team intended to participate in the Spaceport America Cup in 2020, which was cancelled, but the team has been very active since then in both remote and in-person activities and competitions.

**Technical theatre and more:** I have harbored a love for theatre since high school and worked in the costume shop at Macalester. My favorite musical is [*Big Fish*](https://www.theatricalrights.com/show/big-fish/). I am an [avid player](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYdvdoHbrFpmEM9TXPnenIA) of the [Nancy Drew PC game series](https://www.herinteractive.com/shop-games/all-games/), and I frequently indulge my nostalgia by playing [other PC games from my childhood](https://youtu.be/9iby4o_0oVM). I am a fan of the tabletop game Dungeons and Dragons, though I do not play it regularly. I have recently been developing an interest in filmmaking.

Recent Activities
------
- **Summer 2023:** PhD Candidacy Defense

- **May 2023:** Poster, *New Eyes on the Universe: SKA and ngVLA*
  - I attended [New Eyes on the Universe: SKA and ngVLA](https://web.cvent.com/event/0b9d0692-1fed-412e-82f0-212f05a72434/summary) in Vancouver, Canada, where I presented a poster about a potential ngVLA survey of distant star-forming galaxies with a newly-observed "dasar" line of methanol.

- **April 2023:** Poster, *Protostars and Planets VII*
  - I attended [Protostars and Planets VII](http://ppvii.org/) in Kyoto, Japan, where I presented an updated poster on my project using The Brick as a tool to find new tracer molecules for star formation processes in extreme environments.

<!-- - **March 2022:** Masters defense
  - I gave my Masters presentation, entitled "Which spectral lines trace what physical processes in the Galactic Center? First results: temperature structure and line list" based on my work during the first two years of my graduate school career. My presentation is available to watch [here](https://youtu.be/7vltyxZKf9w), with slides available [here](https://abulatek.github.io/files/masters.pdf). -->

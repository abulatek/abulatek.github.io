Hello!
------
> Alyssa Bulatek (she/her) is a fifth-year grad student at UF Astro working with Dr. Adam Ginsburg. She studies the process of star formation in the Milky Way's Galactic Center, using radio telescopes to measure light emitted by molecules (both simple and complex) that uniquely trace age milestones in the infancy of a forming star. In her future, Alyssa hopes to work at a small college as a lecturer and observatory manager. In her spare time, she enjoys reading (sci-fi/fantasy), playing video games (Ace Attorney), and cross-stitching (pixelated versions of impressionist paintings).

Interests
------
**Research:** I'm currently studying **star formation** in the Milky Way. Specifically, I'm trying to uncover molecular tracers of different processes related to star formation in a molecular cloud near the Galactic Center called "The Brick." I am also broadly interested in observational radio astronomy and radio/infrared/optical instrumentation. You can check out some of the projects I have worked on in [my CV](https://abulatek.github.io/files/abulatek_CV.pdf).

<!-- [**Rocketry:**](https://abulatek.github.io/hobbies/) At Macalester, I was involved with Macalester's High Power Rocketry team ([here's their Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/MacRocketry)), and I participated in the design and build processes for several competition rockets: Quantum Field Theory I, Quantum Heavy, and Mach-alester I. Our team intended to participate in the Spaceport America Cup in 2020, which was cancelled, but the team has been very active since then in both remote and in-person activities and competitions. -->

**Technical theatre and more:** I have harbored a love for theatre since high school and worked in the costume shop at Macalester. My favorite musical is [*Big Fish*](https://www.theatricalrights.com/show/big-fish/). I am an [avid player](https://www.youtube.com/@alyssa_ND) of the [Nancy Drew PC game series](https://www.herinteractive.com/shop-games/all-games/), and I frequently indulge my nostalgia by playing [other PC games from my childhood](https://youtu.be/9iby4o_0oVM). I am a fan of the tabletop game Dungeons and Dragons. I have recently been developing an interest in filmmaking.

Recent Activities
------
- **September 2023:** PhD Candidacy Defense
  - I gave my candidacy presentation, entitled "The Brick Line Survey: Star Formation in Extreme Environments." My presentation is available to watch [here](https://youtu.be/oJElAk8nW0Q), with slides available [here](https://abulatek.github.io/files/bulatek_candidacy.pdf).

- **May 2023:** Poster, *New Eyes on the Universe: SKA and ngVLA*
  - I attended [New Eyes on the Universe: SKA and ngVLA](https://web.cvent.com/event/0b9d0692-1fed-412e-82f0-212f05a72434/summary) in Vancouver, Canada, where I presented a poster about a potential ngVLA survey of distant star-forming galaxies with a newly-observed "dasar" line of methanol.

- **April 2023:** Poster, *Protostars and Planets VII*
  - I attended [Protostars and Planets VII](http://ppvii.org/) in Kyoto, Japan, where I presented an updated poster on my project using The Brick as a tool to find new tracer molecules for star formation processes in extreme environments.

<!-- - **March 2022:** Masters defense
  - I gave my Masters presentation, entitled "Which spectral lines trace what physical processes in the Galactic Center? First results: temperature structure and line list" based on my work during the first two years of my graduate school career. My presentation is available to watch [here](https://youtu.be/7vltyxZKf9w), with slides available [here](https://abulatek.github.io/files/masters.pdf). -->

Hello!
======

My name is Alyssa Bulatek (she/her) and I am a [second-year graduate student](https://astro.ufl.edu/directory/alyssa-bulatek/) in the Astronomy department at the University of Florida working with Dr. Adam Ginsburg. I graduated from Macalester College in May 2020. If you would like to know more about things I have gotten to do in my career so far, please see [my CV](https://abulatek.github.io/files/abulatek_CV.pdf) (last updated November 20, 2021).

Interests
------
**Research:** I'm currently studying **star formation** in the Milky Way. Specifically, I'm trying to uncover molecular tracers of different processes related to star formation in a molecular cloud near the Galactic Center called "The Brick." I am also broadly interested in observational radio astronomy and radio/infrared/optical instrumentation. You can check out some of the projects I have worked on in the Research section of [my CV](https://abulatek.github.io/files/abulatek_CV.pdf). 

[**Rocketry:**](https://abulatek.github.io/rocketry/) At Macalester, I was involved with Macalester's High Power Rocketry team ([here's their Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/MacRocketry)), and I participated in the design and build processes for several competition rockets: Quantum Field Theory I, Quantum Heavy, and Mach-alester I. Our team intended to participate in the Spaceport America Cup in 2020, which was cancelled, but the team plans to participate in the summer 2021 competition and is doing lots of other cool remote activities in the meantime. 

**Technical theatre and more:** I have harbored a love for theatre since high school and worked in the costume shop at Macalester. My favorite musical is [*Big Fish*](https://www.theatricalrights.com/show/big-fish/). I am an avid player of the [Nancy Drew PC game series](https://www.herinteractive.com/shop-games/all-games/). I am a big fan of the podcast [The Adventure Zone](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/adventure-zone/). 

Recent Activities
------
- **November 2021:** Attendee, *IAA Severo Ochoa Advanced School on Star Formation*
  - I attended the [IAA Severo Ochoa Advanced School on Star Formation](https://www.granadacongresos.com/starform) in Granada, Spain, where I heard from experts in the field about both the fundamentals and the current "big questions" in the field of star formation, from protostellar to extragalactic scales.

- **May 2021:** Contributed talk, *ISM2021*
  - I gave a talk at the virtual ISM2021 conference summarizing my work so far on our ALMA spectral line survey of the Galactic Central Molecular Zone cloud G0.253+0.015 ("The Brick"). Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/kj7t0HyJ-cU) of my talk.

- **January 2021:** iPoster Plus, *237th Meeting of the American Astronomical Society*
  - I presented my contribution to the proposed Paschen-Alpha Survey of Hydrogen IONs (PASHION) small satellite mission, led by Dr. Adam Ginsburg, at the virtual winter meeting of the AAS this year. Check out my [iPoster](https://aas237-aas.ipostersessions.com/default.aspx?s=0F-63-1D-BA-EC-6C-54-A6-65-E2-1C-15-EE-C5-CD-4C&guestview=true)!

- **September 2020:** Graduate school, *University of Florida*
  - I started graduate school in the Astronomy department at the University of Florida, working with Dr. Adam Ginsburg.

- **April 2020:** Undergraduate Thesis Defense
  - I presented my honors thesis entitled "Design and Modal Analysis of an Ultra-wideband Receiver for Green Bank Observatory" based on my work at from this past summer. My paper is publicly available to read (and my [presentation](https://youtu.be/yq-kfK1X7T8) is available to watch) on the [Macalester Journal of Physics and Astronomy website](https://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/mjpa/vol8/iss1/3/).

*Hello!*
------
My name is Alyssa Bulatek (she/her) and I am a [second-year graduate student](https://astro.ufl.edu/directory/alyssa-bulatek/) in the Astronomy department at the University of Florida working with Dr. Adam Ginsburg. I graduated from Macalester College in May 2020. If you would like to know more about things I have gotten to do in my career so far, please see [my CV](https://abulatek.github.io/cv/) (last updated June 6, 2022).

Interests
------
**Research:** I'm currently studying **star formation** in the Milky Way. Specifically, I'm trying to uncover molecular tracers of different processes related to star formation in a molecular cloud near the Galactic Center called "The Brick." I am also broadly interested in observational radio astronomy and radio/infrared/optical instrumentation. You can check out some of the projects I have worked on in the Research section of [my CV](https://abulatek.github.io/files/abulatek_CV.pdf). 

[**Rocketry:**](https://abulatek.github.io/hobbies/) At Macalester, I was involved with Macalester's High Power Rocketry team ([here's their Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/MacRocketry)), and I participated in the design and build processes for several competition rockets: Quantum Field Theory I, Quantum Heavy, and Mach-alester I. Our team intended to participate in the Spaceport America Cup in 2020, which was cancelled, but the team has been very active since then in both remote and in-person activities and competitions.

**Technical theatre and more:** I have harbored a love for theatre since high school and worked in the costume shop at Macalester. My favorite musical is [*Big Fish*](https://www.theatricalrights.com/show/big-fish/). I am an [avid player](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYdvdoHbrFpmEM9TXPnenIA) of the [Nancy Drew PC game series](https://www.herinteractive.com/shop-games/all-games/), and I frequently indulge my nostalgia by playing [other PC games from my childhood](https://youtu.be/9iby4o_0oVM). I am a fan of the tabletop game Dungeons and Dragons, though I do not play it regularly. I have recently been developing an interest in filmmaking.

Recent Activities
------
- **March 2022:** Masters defense
  - I gave my Masters presentation, entitled "Which spectral lines trace what physical processes in the Galactic Center? First results: temperature structure and line list" based on my work during the first two years of my graduate school career. My presentation is available to watch [here](https://youtu.be/7vltyxZKf9w), with slides available [here](https://abulatek.github.io/files/masters.pdf).

- **November 2021:** Attendee, *IAA Severo Ochoa Advanced School on Star Formation*
  - I attended the [IAA Severo Ochoa Advanced School on Star Formation](https://www.granadacongresos.com/starform) in Granada, Spain, where I heard from experts in the field about both the fundamentals and the current "big questions" in the field of star formation, from protostellar to extragalactic scales.

- **May 2021:** Contributed talk, *ISM2021*
  - I gave a talk at the virtual ISM2021 conference summarizing my work so far on our ALMA spectral line survey of the Galactic Central Molecular Zone cloud G0.253+0.015 ("The Brick"). Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/kj7t0HyJ-cU) of my talk.
